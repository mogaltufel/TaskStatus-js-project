# TaskStatus-js-project
to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a website or app for to-do lists. We can add our task list and indicate whether a task is finished or not in this to-do list. The new task will be added to the list if we type it in the input field and click the "Add" button. To indicate if a work is finished or not, we simply click on its name. In order to remove the specific activity from the ToDo list, we will add a close icon.
We are utilizing local storage in this JavaScript project to save the to-do list or task list in your web browser. This way, even if you close and restart the browser, the list will still be visible.
